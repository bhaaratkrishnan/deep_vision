The Military ThreatRussia has assembled troops at Ukrainian border with heavy gear and established new bases, according to Western intelligence agencies.
The US has already sent nearly 5,000 additional troops to Poland as well as additional fighter aircraft, in response to the Ukraine crisis.
The Ukraine crisis has prompted the US-led NATO alliance to shore up its presence along its eastern flank in member states, including Lithuania, closer to Russia or Ukraine.
On Thursday, Russia sent a strongly-worded letter to Washington threatening unspecified "military-technical measures".</p>

With BJP pulling out all stops to woo its traditional vote bank in cities, Malwa may throw up some close but surprising results.
Even Punjab Lok Congress chief, former CM Capt Amarinder Singh, is contesting from his citadel of Patiala.
It is the silence which the AAP is counting on and which unnerves the trio of BJP, SAD and the Congress,” said a political analyst.
A feedback was sought from the Malwa belt and seat-wise feedback was given,” said a senior dera functionary, preferring anonymity.</p>
