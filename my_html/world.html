The Military ThreatRussia has assembled troops at Ukrainian border with heavy gear and established new bases, according to Western intelligence agencies.
The US has already sent nearly 5,000 additional troops to Poland as well as additional fighter aircraft, in response to the Ukraine crisis.
The Ukraine crisis has prompted the US-led NATO alliance to shore up its presence along its eastern flank in member states, including Lithuania, closer to Russia or Ukraine.
On Thursday, Russia sent a strongly-worded letter to Washington threatening unspecified "military-technical measures".</p>

                                                <p>So what's behind the UK's recent spate of dangerous wind storms?
Now the UK faces Storm Eunice, and its gusts of up to 122 miles per hour.
Our research team's new high-resolution climate models predict bigger increases in winter rainfall than standard global climate models due to a large increase in rainfall from thunderstorms during winter.
We are less certain about how the pattern of extreme wind storms, like Eunice, will change, as the relevant processes are much more complicated.
Some aspects of climate change strengthen the jet stream, leading to more UK wind storms.</p>

The central government has asked to do so after considering the trend of new cases and positivity rate in their regions, stating a sustained downward</p>

                                                <p>A recent lab study suggested that the BA.2 subvariant of the Omicron coronavirus variant may possess certain features that not only make it more transmissible, but also more capable of causing severe disease.
This comes at a time when several countries are lifting measures put in place to contain the Omicron variant as the recent wave of infections driven by it appears to be waning.
The BA.2 sub-variant of Omicron has spread rapidly in countries including Denmark, Philippines, South Africa and the United Kingdom in the past few weeks.
While the sub-variant follows the initial spread of the BA.1 sub-variant of Omicron, it has now started outcompeting BA.1, suggesting more transmissibility, according to researchers.
The study, conducted by a team of researchers at the University of Tokyo, found that similar to BA.1, BA.2 subvariant of Omicron appears to largely escape the immunity induced by COVID-19 vaccines.</p>

                                                <p>A cargo ship carrying thousands of luxury cars from the Volkswagen Group, including Porsche, Lamborghini and Audi, caught fire near the Azores islands in the Atlantic Ocean on Wednesday afternoon.
While the 22 crew members were successfully evacuated, the transport ship was left adrift and unmanned in the ocean.
The ship named ‘The Felicity Ace’ was on its way to the port of Davisville in the US state of Rhode Island when the tragedy struck the vessel.
“Our immediate thoughts are of relief that the 22 crew of the merchant ship Felicity Ace are safe and well,” Vandezande said.
When the Grande America caught fire and sank in 2019, over 2,000 luxury cars, including Audi and Porsche, sank with it.</p>
