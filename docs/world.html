                                                </header>
                                                <p>COVID-19: Hong Kong has long adhered to the mainland's "zero-Covid" policy.
The extremely contagious Omicron variant was first discovered within Hong Kong's local community in late December -- far later than much of the rest of the world.
As of Friday, Hong Kong had recorded more than 20,200 infections in less than two months -- outstripping its cumulative two-year total of about 12,000.
Hong Kong's policy under previous outbreaks was to hospitalise all Covid-19 patients -- even those with mild symptoms.
Hong Kong officials clung to the same zero-tolerance approach even as health experts warned the walls would not hold forever.</p>

Putin together with his Belarusian counterpart Alexander Lukashenko observed the test launches of ballistic missiles at the control center.
According to the Russian Defense Ministry, the strategic deterrence drills were planned, with maneuvers involving the Russian Aerospace Forces, Southern Military District units, Strategic Missile Forces, and Northern and the Black Sea fleets.

                                                <p>Late Friday night, Ottawa police, who pledged the operation would push ahead "until residents and citizens have their city back," were still working to clear the capital's streets.
No one was seriously hurt, they added, with Ottawa interim police chief Steve Bell saying the operation was going as planned but would take time.
An AFP journalist saw several demonstrators led away in handcuffs as police and tow trucks moved in, although most simply surrendered.
The so-called "Freedom Convoy", which inspired copycat protests in other countries, began with truckers demonstrating against mandatory Covid-19 vaccines to cross the US border.
Speaker of the House Anthony Rota cited an "ever-changing" situation in the streets outside the seat of Canada's democracy.</p>

                                                <p>WASHINGTON: Russian President Vladimir Putin has decided to invade Ukraine , US President Joe Biden claimed on Friday, citing Washington's "significant intelligence capability," while warning Moscow that "if it pursues its plans, it will be responsible for a catastrophic and needless war of choice.
"The alarming remarks came as Putin is scheduled to preside over war games, including nuclear drills, that is taking place amid firefighting in Ukraine's border areas with Russia that US suspects is a smokescreen for the impending invasion.
"We’ve seen reports of a major uptick of violations of the ceasefire by Russian-backed fighters attempting to provoke Ukraine — and we continue to see more disinformation pushed out to the public.
All of this is consistent with the playbook that the Russians have used before," Biden said in remarks at the White House and later on Twitter, adding, "As of this moment, I’m convinced he’s made the decision (to invade Ukraine).
"Biden went so far as to claim Putin "will target Ukraine’s capital Kyiv , a city of 2.8 million innocent people."</p>
