                                                <p>After separate calls with France's President Emmanuel Macron, both Russian leader Vladimir Putin and Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky pressed for more talks.
During his 105-minute discussion with Macron, Putin said "the cause of the escalation is provocations carried out by the Ukrainian security forces", according to a Kremlin statement.
Earlier, fears of escalation mounted after Belarus announced that Russian forces would remain on its soil after Sunday's scheduled end to joint drills.
Occupied enclaveThe Moscow-backed separatists have accused Ukraine of planning an offensive into their enclave, despite the huge Russian military build-up on the frontier.
The rebel regions have made similar claims about Ukraine's forces and ordered a general mobilisation, while staging an evacuation of civilians into neighbouring Russian territory.</p>

                                                <p>The United States and Britain have repeatedly cautioned that Russia is about to invade Ukraine, a step Washington and London say would trigger the biggest conflict since the end of World War Two.
Here are the latest developments in this big story:- French President Emmanuel Macron called Russian leader Vladimir Putin on Sunday about the situation in Ukraine in a last-ditch effort to avert a Russian invasion of Ukraine.
- Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the repeated warnings by the West that Russia was about to invade Ukraine were provocative and could have adverse consequences, without giving details.
Russia has repeatedly denied preparing to invade Ukraine.
- Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called on Russian President Vladimir Putin to choose a place where the two leaders could meet to try to resolve the crisis.</p>

“That changed, because we had agreements with China not to bring military forces [to] the Line of Actual Control and the Chinese violated those agreements.
Jaishankar responded by cautioning countries against getting caught in a debt trap while accepting China’s assistance.
We have seen projects which are commercially unsustainable – airports where an aircraft doesn’t come, harbours where a ship doesn’t come.
In the case of unsustainable projects, “debt becomes equity and that becomes something else”, he warned.</p>

The app is expected to be launched in Apple’s App Store on Monday (February 21), according to posts from an executive on a test version accessed by Reuters.
In October 2021, Trump had announced he was launching a social media platform, called Truth Social to "stand up to the tyranny of Big Tech.” The app is owned by the recently created Trump Media & Technology Group.
“We’re currently set for release in the Apple App store for Monday, Feb. 21,” the executive responded.
The parent company of Truth Social, Trump Media & Technology Group is headed by former Republican US Representative Devin Nunes.</p>

Bill Gates told the news channel that large parts of the global population have achieved a certain level of protection against coronavirus.
“The cost of being ready for the next pandemic is not that large,” Gates told CNBC.
Gates’ foundation, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, has been a part of the global effort to distribute COVID-19 vaccines.
COVAX aims to speed up the development and manufacturing of COVID-19 vaccines and ensure that all countries have fair and equitable access to them.</p>

It's not post-2020 development, he said, referring to the tension along the Line of Actual Control in eastern Ladakh with China.
"Our relations with the quad partners -- the US, Japan and Australia -- have steadily improved in the last 20 years.
I don't think the quad necessarily has an identical view on all subjects, including on the TRIPS waiver.
India ranks 5th after Japan and the US, UAE and China, Jaishankar said that India's relations with the ASEAN are growing well.</p>

                                                <p>Late Friday night, Ottawa police, who pledged the operation would push ahead "until residents and citizens have their city back," were still working to clear the capital's streets.
No one was seriously hurt, they added, with Ottawa interim police chief Steve Bell saying the operation was going as planned but would take time.
An AFP journalist saw several demonstrators led away in handcuffs as police and tow trucks moved in, although most simply surrendered.
The so-called "Freedom Convoy", which inspired copycat protests in other countries, began with truckers demonstrating against mandatory Covid-19 vaccines to cross the US border.
Speaker of the House Anthony Rota cited an "ever-changing" situation in the streets outside the seat of Canada's democracy.</p>

                                                <p>External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar arrived in Paris for athree-day visit to cement bilateral defence cooperation as well as discuss the security environment in Indo-Pacific.
He will address a conference of EU Foreign Ministers on Indo-Pacific as well as hold a Head of Mission conference for Indian envoys in Europe.
Jaishankar's visit comes day after his visit to the Munich Security Conference in Germany, marked by his firm counter to the critics calling the Quad alliance as an Asian version of NATO..
During the Munich Security Conference, Jaishankar had described that India's ties with China were going through a difficult phase.
When the event's moderator asked about India's role in European security vis-à-vis Ukrainian crisis, Jaishankar denied that the two events were analogous.</p>
