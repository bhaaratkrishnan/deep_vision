The Military ThreatRussia has assembled troops at Ukrainian border with heavy gear and established new bases, according to Western intelligence agencies.
The US has already sent nearly 5,000 additional troops to Poland as well as additional fighter aircraft, in response to the Ukraine crisis.
The Ukraine crisis has prompted the US-led NATO alliance to shore up its presence along its eastern flank in member states, including Lithuania, closer to Russia or Ukraine.
On Thursday, Russia sent a strongly-worded letter to Washington threatening unspecified "military-technical measures".</p>

                                                <p>The Omicron variant, which led the third wave of the coronavirus pandemic, is slowing down across the world.
But, a World health Organization (WHO) official has raised a fresh concern related to an Omicron sub-strain.
In the tweet accompanying the video, the WHO said that almost 75,000 deaths from Covid-19 were reported last week.
BA.2 now accounts for roughly one in five new Omicron cases recorded across the world, according to the WHO.
In a briefing on Tuesday, the WHO said that a new wave of infections from the Omicron variant of the coronavirus is moving towards the east of Europe, urging authorities to improve vaccination and other measures.</p>

His office said that he was “very concerned on the plans to ban Hindu sacred symbol Swastika.
Sharma also said there was a campaign to oppose the bill as it would “criminalise the swastika”.
Organisations, including the Hindu temple in Burnaby and the Gurukul Cultural Society of Canada, participated in the protest last Sunday.
One of the participants, Neema Manral said they are demanding that the swastika word be removed from the bill and replaced with Nazi symbols.</p>

                                                <p>Russia-Ukraine Conflict: Tensions have been increasing between Ukraine and Russia.
The leaders of Ukraine's two breakaway regions announced a general mobilisation Saturday, spurring fears of a further escalation in fighting in the ex-Soviet country.
Pushilin claimed his region's forces had prevented attacks he said were planned by Ukraine security services, and that the Ukrainian army had continued attacks.
We will protect Donbas and all Russian people," Pushilin added, using the term for eastern Ukraine.
More than 14,000 people have been killed in fighting between Ukraine's army and Moscow-supported separatists since fighting broke out in 2014.</p>
