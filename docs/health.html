Weight gain and weight loss are complex processes that involve a host of factors such as genetics, lifestyle, environmental markers, diet components etc.
This is because it is still unclear as to what effects weight loss programmes have on different people.

                                                <p>Weighing roughly 1,025 kgs, Perseverance is the heaviest rover ever to safely land on Mars, and also return with dramatic videos of its landing.
The six-wheeled scientist achieved many insights on the Red Planet including the first rock core samples from another planet (it's carrying six, so far).
The rover served as an indispensable base station for Ingenuity, the first helicopter on Mars, and tested MOXIE (Mars Oxygen In-Situ Resource Utilisation Experiment), the first prototype oxygen generator on the Red Planet, NASA said.
Perseverance also recently broke a record for the most distance driven by a Mars rover in a single day, travelling almost 1,050 feet (320 meters) on February 14, 2022, the 351st Martian day, or sol, of the mission.
"Bringing back a sample from this heavily cratered surface in Jezero could provide a tie-point to calibrate the Mars crater dating system independently, instead of relying solely on the lunar one," Morgan added.</p>

                                                <p>WASHINGTON — A Northrop Grumman Antares rocket launched a Cygnus cargo spacecraft carrying several tons of cargo for the International Space Station Feb. 19.
The spacecraft is scheduled to arrive at the station early Feb. 21 and be berthed by the station’s Canadarm2 robotic arm.
The Cygnus spacecraft, named by Northrop the S.S. Piers Sellers after the late NASA astronaut, is carrying nearly 3,800 kilograms of cargo for the station.
An invasion and reactions to it could pose long-term issues for the Antares rocket.
NASA concluded Astra’s cargo capacity was also well below the CRS2 contract requirement, and that the company had not started development of the cargo vehicle.</p>
