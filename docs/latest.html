                                            <p>While the launch of Google's next Pixel series is still months away, the first few concrete details of the Pixel 7 and 7 Pro are here.
9to5Google has uncovered the details about the new lineup including the devices' codenames, the Tensor chip used, and their Samsung modem.
As per 9to5Google, the Pixel 7 and the Pixel 7 Pro are most likely to be powered by Google's second-generation Tensor chipset.
The codenames for the Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro are reportedly Cheetah and Panther, which is interesting because up until before the Pixel 6 generation Google's only used codenames related to fish or other sea life.
Similarly, the speculation goes, maybe "Raven" in "Ravenclaw" refers to the Pixel 6 Pro and "claw" is just a feline reference, in which case this would be a Pixel 6 Pro device with Pixel 7 innards, created for testing purposes.</p>

                                            <p>Coal India continues to be under government pressure to maintain supplies of the fossil fuel, which the country relies on for about 70% of electricity generation.
Coal inventories at power plants tumbled late last year as mine output lagged demand, triggering power outages and supply curbs.
A “price hike should take place immediately, it has become very urgent for Coal India," Agrawal said on the Thursday call.
“Otherwise, coal production in the country will suffer."
Coal India expects to supply 670 million tons in the fiscal year ending March, almost 17% higher than a year earlier.</p>

                                            <p>In order to identify new COVID variants, testing is critical, World Health Organisation (WHO) pointed out.
You need to know how the virus is changing so that the interventions can be adapted and tailored to where they are needed most," WHO's Maria Van Kerkhove said.
This comes at a time when WHO officials have notified that testing rates have fallen sharply across the globe.
But if you’re living in a developing country where you might spend five or ten dollars per person on health for the whole year, five antigen tests or ten antigen tests are massively expensive.
Why it is difficult to identify new variants early?</p>

Amazon-Future matterThe company is in a legal fight with e-commerce major Amazon over the sale of retail, wholesale, logistics and warehousing businesses by its promoters and Future group to Reliance Retail for ₹24,713 crore.
However, e-commerce major Amazon is contesting the deal through its 49 per cent stake in Future Coupons Pvt Ltd (FCPL), which is a shareholder in Future Retail.
Reliance Retail Ventures had for the second time extended the timeline for completing its ₹24,713 crore deal with Future group to 31 March 2022, as it still awaits regulatory and judicial clearances.</p>
