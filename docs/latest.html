Amazon-Future matterThe company is in a legal fight with e-commerce major Amazon over the sale of retail, wholesale, logistics and warehousing businesses by its promoters and Future group to Reliance Retail for ₹24,713 crore.
However, e-commerce major Amazon is contesting the deal through its 49 per cent stake in Future Coupons Pvt Ltd (FCPL), which is a shareholder in Future Retail.
Reliance Retail Ventures had for the second time extended the timeline for completing its ₹24,713 crore deal with Future group to 31 March 2022, as it still awaits regulatory and judicial clearances.</p>
