He accused the former Uttar Pradesh chief minister and the BJP’s rivals in the state of patronising goons and the mafia.
Accusing Yadav of “withdrawing cases of terrorists accused of bomb blasts”, Nadda said, “The court did not spare these accused.
Among the prominent faces contesting in Punjab are CM Charanjit Singh Channi, Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu, Aam Aadmi Party’s chief ministerial face Bhagwant Mann, former CMs Amarinder Singh and Parkash Singh Badal, and Shiromani Akali Dal president Sukhbir Singh Badal.
This phase will see Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav contesting from the Karhal assembly seat in Mainpuri district.</p>

Later, he also met Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) president Sharad Pawar.

At a joint press conference with KCR, Thackeray said that the duo will meet many political leaders henceforth, while emphasising that the decision on the prime ministerial face for the third front can be made “later”.
KCR has already received the support of DMK chief and Tamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalin, and is going to meet Trinamool Congress (TMC) supremo and his West Bengal counterpart Mamata Banerjee as well.</p>

This comes hours after the embassy urged the Indian nationals in Ukraine, whose stay is not essential, to leave the country temporarily.
The embassy also asked Indian students to also get in touch with respective student contractors for updates on charter flights.
It had asked its citizens to leave Kyiv temporarily amid the ongoing tension between Russia and Ukraine earlier on 15 February too.
The presence of the Russian troops raised concern that they could be used to sweep down on the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv.</p>

"Post-mortem will be conducted at the Hathras hospital," Resham Pal said, adding that Krishna Yadav was a worker of both the BJP Yuva Morcha and the Hindu Yuva Vahini.</p>

"On its part, Moscow says the US and Nato allies have not responded to specific proposals by Russia to take the talks forward.
"In US, right wing commentators trolled the Biden administration and "credulous" mainstream media, saying they first claimed Russia would invade Ukraine on the 16th, and when no invasion came, moved the goalpost to the 20th.
