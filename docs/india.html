Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed confidence that India's rising capability in the drone sector will give the world a new leadership, as he flagged off 100 'kisan drones' in different parts of the country for spraying pesticides and other farm materials.
PM Modi launched the drones on Friday with officials describing it as a "very novel and exciting initiative" for farmers.
In his speech, the prime minister said a new culture of drone start-ups is getting ready in India.
He said 'kisan drones' are the beginning of a new revolution.</p>

With BJP pulling out all stops to woo its traditional vote bank in cities, Malwa may throw up some close but surprising results.
Even Punjab Lok Congress chief, former CM Capt Amarinder Singh, is contesting from his citadel of Patiala.
It is the silence which the AAP is counting on and which unnerves the trio of BJP, SAD and the Congress,” said a political analyst.
A feedback was sought from the Malwa belt and seat-wise feedback was given,” said a senior dera functionary, preferring anonymity.</p>

                                                <p>The instances of shelling across Ukraine’s eastern regions, where the pro-Russian separatists rule the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, have raised concerns that despite some signs of drawdown tensions continue to be heightened between Russia and Ukraine.
The US president Joe Biden in his remarks on Friday said he still believes Russia will invade Ukraine and reiterated that Kyiv will fall to Russia when it invades.
Despite Russia withdrawing some units last week, the US says that it has positioned 150,000 troops near Ukraine’s borders.
Meanwhile, the Organization for Security and Co-operation (OSCE) said that it has seen a rise in ceasefire violations across eastern Ukraine.
Along with Russian forces, Ukraine faces militia from separatists in Donetsk and Luhansk who hold those regions in the eastern part of the country.</p>

The Indore Bio-CNG plant has been constructed under the overarching principles of “waste to wealth” and “circular economy” for maximising resource recovery.
It is also expected to yield multiple environmental benefits like reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, providing green energy along with organic compost as fertiliser, as per PMO.
IMC will purchase a minimum of 50% of CNG produced by the Gobar-Dhan plant.
The organic compost will help replace chemical fertilisers for agricultural and horticultural purposes,” an official release said.</p>
