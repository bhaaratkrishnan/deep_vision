In fact, we have given complete autonomy to the CDC as well as the private college management," the AG argued further.
On the charge that the GO was against hijab, Navadgi said the question of hijab was not there unless they want him to read something which he was not able to read.
The question of asking an institution to proscribe or prescribe hijab -- where does the state come into the picture" the advocate general asked.

At places where the SAD and BJP candidates are facing one another, the dera will support the strong candidate having a clean image.
The dera has maintained that support would not be extended to those candidates who do not adhered to their policies and programmes.
It has extended support to BJP candidate Dr Harjot Kamal in Moga, Akali stalwart Tota Singh in Dharamkot; besides BJP candidates in Ferozepur Urban, Fazilka, Abohar, Balluana and a few other constituencies in the Malwa belt.
