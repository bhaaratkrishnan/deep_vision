The two, meeting for the first time since Nitish Kumar sacked Prashant Kishor as his party's number two in 2020, were reportedly closeted for two hours at the Bihar Chief Minister's official home in Delhi.
Nitish Kumar confirmed the dinner meet to reporters in Delhi but said he has old ties with Prashant Kishor and not much should be read into the meeting.
When Nitish Kumar caught an Omicron infection, he explained, he had phoned him to ask after his health.
Nitish Kumar had then expressed his desire to meet, and this materialised yesterday, he said.</p>

                                                <p>(AP)Russia Ukraine Crisis Live: Russia hit sea and land-based targets with ballistic and cruise missiles on Saturday as part of strategic nuclear exercises overseen by President Vladimir Putin and his Belarusian counterpart, the Kremlin said.
The annual exercises featured launches of Kinzhal and Tsirkon hypersonic missiles and a number of other weapons, the Kremlin said in a statement.
Meanwhile, speaking at the Munich Security Conference on Saturday, US vice-president Kamala Harris warned of “significant and unprecedented economic costs” if Russia invades Ukraine.
The Ukrainian military said a soldier was killed in shelling by pro-Russian separatists on Saturday morning in east Ukraine, where violence this week in a long-running conflict has stirred concern it could be the triggger for Russian military action.
US President Joe Biden said Friday he is convinced that Russian leader Vladimir Putin has decided to invade Ukraine in the coming days.</p>
