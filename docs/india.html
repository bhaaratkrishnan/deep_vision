The two, meeting for the first time since Nitish Kumar sacked Prashant Kishor as his party's number two in 2020, were reportedly closeted for two hours at the Bihar Chief Minister's official home in Delhi.
Nitish Kumar confirmed the dinner meet to reporters in Delhi but said he has old ties with Prashant Kishor and not much should be read into the meeting.
When Nitish Kumar caught an Omicron infection, he explained, he had phoned him to ask after his health.
Nitish Kumar had then expressed his desire to meet, and this materialised yesterday, he said.</p>

                                                <p>Tribune News ServiceAman SoodPatiala, February 18It is not common for traditional parties to open election offices, but they did so this time.
With BJP pulling out all stops to woo its traditional vote bank in cities, Malwa may throw up some close but surprising results.
Even Punjab Lok Congress chief, former CM Capt Amarinder Singh, is contesting from his citadel of Patiala.
It is the silence which the AAP is counting on and which unnerves the trio of BJP, SAD and the Congress,” said a political analyst.
A feedback was sought from the Malwa belt and seat-wise feedback was given,” said a senior dera functionary, preferring anonymity.</p>
