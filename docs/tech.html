On Feb. 15 Trump's eldest son Donald Jr. posted on Twitter a screenshot of his father's verified @realDonaldTrump Truth Social account with one post, or "truth," that he uploaded on Feb. 14: "Get Ready!
Apple's App Store listing indicates that Truth Social is expected to be released on Feb. 21, a date that a source familiar with the venture confirmed in January.
The ability to edit posts after publication is something Twitter users have long sought.
Truth Social will issue a policy on verified accounts "in the coming weeks," the executive added.</p>

                                                <p>AMD is now about $1 billion short of Intel's roughly $182 billion market cap, both far from Nvidia's (NVDA.O) $585 billion.
In servers, AMD had less than 5% market share in 2018, but now holds 15%.
In PCs, he expects AMD market share to reach high 20s from its current 18% to 20% range.
But Wall Street is less enthused with Intel's latest chip plans, which analysts said lacked "credibility" amid tough competition, and include muted gross margin growth and aggressive spending.

On its U.S. website, the Model 3 description said: "Go anywhere with "up to" 358 miles of estimated range on a single charge."
The description for Hyundai Motor Co's (005380.KS) Ioniq 5 midsize crossover also states its range as travelling a "maximum" 429km on a single charge.</p>
