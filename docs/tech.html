                                                <p>Feb 17 (Reuters) - E-commerce sites operated by China's Tencent Holdings Ltd (0700.HK) and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (9988.HK) were added to the U.S. government's latest "notorious markets" list, the U.S. Trade Representative's office said on Thursday.
The list identifies 42 online markets and 35 physical markets that are reported to engage in or facilitate substantial trademark counterfeiting or copyright piracy.
"This includes identifying for the first time AliExpress and the WeChat e-commerce ecosystem, two significant China-based online markets that reportedly facilitate substantial trademark counterfeiting," the USTR office said in a statement.
China does not agree with the U.S. government's decision to include some e-commerce sites in its notorious markets list, calling the action "irresponsible," the Chinese ministry of commerce said on Friday.
The United States and China have been engaged in trade tensions for years over issues like tariffs, technology and intellectual property, among others.</p>

                                                <p>AMD is now about $1 billion short of Intel's roughly $182 billion market cap, both far from Nvidia's (NVDA.O) $585 billion.
In servers, AMD had less than 5% market share in 2018, but now holds 15%.
In PCs, he expects AMD market share to reach high 20s from its current 18% to 20% range.
But Wall Street is less enthused with Intel's latest chip plans, which analysts said lacked "credibility" amid tough competition, and include muted gross margin growth and aggressive spending.

REUTERS/Kim Hong-JiSEOUL, Feb 18 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) changed an advertisement about the driving range for its Model 3 in South Korea after an antitrust regulator found that the automaker exaggerated the specifications of its batteries.

On its U.S. website, the Model 3 description said: "Go anywhere with "up to" 358 miles of estimated range on a single charge."
The description for Hyundai Motor Co's (005380.KS) Ioniq 5 midsize crossover also states its range as travelling a "maximum" 429km on a single charge.</p>
