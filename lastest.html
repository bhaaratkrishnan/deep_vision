                                        <p>The Union Finance Ministry said on Friday announced that the World Bank will provide $115 million ( ₹869 crore) loan to fund a programme in India that will help national and state institutions adopt improved watershed management practices to increase farmers' resilience to climate change, promote higher productivity and better incomes.
As India has one of the largest watershed management programmes in the world, the new programme will further boost the watershed management system in the country.
As per the agreement, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) financing will support Karnataka with $60 million ( ₹453.5 crore), Odisha with $49 million ( ₹370 crore), and the remaining $6 million ( ₹45.5 crore) will be for the central government's Department of Land Resources, news agency ANI reported.
The $115 million ( ₹869 crore) loan has a maturity of 15 years, including a grace period of 4.5 years, the Finance Ministry said.
Effective watershed management can help enhance livelihoods in rainfed areas while building a more resilient food system.</p>
